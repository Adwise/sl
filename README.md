The Adwise Typo Train
=======================================

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.

Build and Install
-----------------

With brew on MacOS:

    $ brew install adwise/brew/sl

Run it with:

    $ sl

For more variants check

    $ man sl
